# Password Generator

## Description

This simple password generator will allow a user to select character type and length criteria for a password and then will generate a password that matches these criteria for the user to copy and paste at will.

## Usage

Click on the "Generate Password" button in order to generate the prompts for password criteria.

Select the types of characters and the length that are needed for the password and the password result field will automatically update.

At least one character type must be selected and the length input must be between 8 and 128 characters. For convenience, the length field defaults to a value of 8. Updating any of the input fields will change the password, as well as clicking on the "Generate Password" button again. The generated password may be copied and pasted wherever needed.
